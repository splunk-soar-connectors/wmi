Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) ports need to be opened up on the endpoint for the app to
run WMI commands remotely. Depending upon your setup, this configuration can be part of a Group
Policy Object (GPO) or carried out individually on the endpoint.

This app does not support proxies, and it will ignore any proxy settings.
